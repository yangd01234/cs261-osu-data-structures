1. How many cost units are spent in the entire process of performing 32 consecutive push operations on an empty array which startsout at capacity 8, assuming that the array will double in capacity each time  a new item is added to an already full dynamic array? AsN (ie. the number of pushes) grows large, under this strategy for resizing, what is the big-oh complexity for a push?The total time of push would be 32+8+16 = 56The big-oh complexity for the push is O(1)+ because it is not a guaranteed execution time bound.  2.
